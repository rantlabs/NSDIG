# NSDDIG

`nsdig` scans text streams for IPv4 addresses, performs reverse DNS lookups, and prefixes each line with the resolved hostname (or `NONAME` when no PTR record exists). The tool is optimized for large router dumps and supports both streaming stdout and buffered file outputs.

## Build

```bash
go build -o nsdig .
```

Use Go 1.21 or newer. The command above emits an executable named `nsdig` in the repository root.

## Usage

```bash
./nsdig -file INPUT.txt             # Read from a file
./nsdig -ip 8.8.8.8                 # Single address
cat INPUT.txt | ./nsdig             # Pipe/STDIN
./nsdig < INPUT.txt                 # File redirect / STDIN
./nsdig -file INPUT.txt -o out.txt  # Buffered write to a file (no streaming)
./nsdig -file INPUT.txt -workers 32 # Custom worker pool size
```

If no input source is provided (flag, pipe, or redirect), the program prints the help text.

## Sample Input & Output

Input text file:
```text
Edge01 | log | Internet  8.8.8.8    ...
Edge02 | log | Internet  1.1.1.1    ...
```

Output STDOUT:
```text
dns.google Edge01 | log | Internet  8.8.8.8    ...
one.one.one.one Edge02 | log | Internet  1.1.1.1    ...
```

When a lookup fails:
```text
NONAME Edge03 | log | Internet  203.0.113.10 ...
```

## Notes

- STDOUT mode streams each line as soon as its lookup completes; `-o` defers writing until the entire file is processed.
- Hostnames are resolved with Go’s `net.LookupAddr`; if a PTR record contains characters Go rejects, `nsdig` falls back to parsing the system `nslookup` output.
- Provide your own public data for demos; the repo’s `*_example.txt` files are for in-house regression tests.
